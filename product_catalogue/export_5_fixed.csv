<h3>Gild</h3>
<p>'It's the arrogance of men to think so little of women. And it'll be their downfall too.'</p>
<p>Locked away in a castle on the snowy mountains in the Sixth Kingdom of Orea, I have never known freedom. No one can get in or out. Apart from him. King Midas, who rescued me from the streets, gave me food, shelter, and his heart. I promised to love him forever. But when political upheaval sends me across kingdoms to a future I no longer understand, everything I thought I knew about King Midas is shattered. The world has only ever heard his story. Now it's time to hear mine.</p>

<h3>Glint</h3>
<p>'I hope you burn so bright that you scorch your Golden King down to ash.'</p>
<p>After ten years, I have left the grips of one king only to fall into the hands of another. I have fought the terrifying Red Raid Pirates, endured the murder of those I care about, and survived the frozen plains of Orea, only to find myself a prisoner of the Fourth Kingdom's army. Leading the army is Commander Rip, a notorious warrior whose name is whispered in taverns and street corners across the six kingdoms. But as I get to know him, I realize the tales of his brutality aren't true. He is fae, part of the powerful and magical people said to have abandoned this world three hundred years ago. Yet here he stands before me. When he turns his onyx eyes upon me, I fall captive for an entirely different reason. As his army marches towards a battle with the king I once adored, I must decide: Midas or Rip. Loyalty or freedom. In this game of war.</p>

I have fought the terrifying Red Raid Pirates, endured the murder of those I care about, and survived the frozen planes of Orea, only to find myself a prisoner of the army of Fourth Kingdom. Leading the army is Commander Rip, a notorious warrior whose name is whispered in taverns and street corners all over the six kingdoms. But as I get to know him, I realise that the tales of his brutality aren't true. He is something else. He is fae. Part of the powerful and magical people who are said to have abandoned this world entirely three hundred years ago. But here one stands before me. And when he turns his onyx eyes upon me, I fall captive. For an entirely different reason. As his army march towards a battle with the king I once adored, I must decide. Midas or Rip. Loyalty or freedom. In this game of war and love, it's my turn to choose. Gleam 'I don't choose him. Not anymore. I'm choosing me.' I was told that being confined was to keep the bad out . . . Until I realized it was about keeping me in. Midas made me forbidden and weak. Little did he know that I would find my wings and voice - which sings now. After living amongst the terrifying army of Fourth Kingdom, I find myself, once again, in strange lands and a kingdom surrounded by liars. But something has ignited within me. Something dark. Something angry. Then comes King Ravinger. And the last thing I wanted was my heart to be torn. Can I really fall in love when the cities around me threaten to crumble and my fate hangs in the balance? One thing is for sure, I won't be caught in a cage again. No, this time, it'll be me setting the trap. Glow 'It scares me - what I did that night. Because I don't know my own power . . . But that's been the problem all along, hasn't it?' My life has been shaped and controlled by the greed of others, but that ends now. I have burned down the court of King Midas and from those flames, I will rise and wield my own power. The problem is, when you turn against a King - everyone turns against you. But with Slade by my side we will fight the monarchs that come for us. And if we need to become the villains, then so be it. Because as long as I live in this world, I won't be used again. I must be strong. I must be undefeatable. I will shine like the sun - and blind our enemies . . . Gold â€˜Find me in another life. Find me in them allâ€™ Every end is also a beginning. I was going to die. If it werenâ€™t for Slade, I would have. But he ripped the world open for me and I went through it. To Annwyn. To home. Annwyn is the realm of the fae, a magical place full of beauty and danger. Here, I am known as LyÃ¤ri UlvÃªre â€“ the golden one gone. And there are people in this world who want to keep me that way. But I am not that girl in the gilded cage anymore, and no one is going to use me again. Or stop me from finding my way back to Slade. I am my own woman. And I will find him. In this world, or the next. Goldfinch One king caged my body. Another has caged my mind. War has broken out between Annwyn and Orea, though thatâ€™s not the only battle being waged. Thereâ€™s a fight inside me, and itâ€™s one Iâ€™m determined to win, no matter how much they try to strip me down and hollow me out. Yet theyâ€™ve forgotten one thing. The ancient magic of the pair bond. One can never truly be lost when two souls are already bound. Because Slade and I? We are connected by more than just fated magic, and we will always find each other. In any life. The fae king is trying to destroy me. My heritage. My memory. But what he hasnâ€™t realized is this: gold bends, but stone breaks.","","","","","9.78108E+12","en","","","Penguin","","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

<h3>Description:</h3>

<h4>The Chase</h4>
<p>Everyone says opposites attract, and they must be right, because there's no logical reason why I'm so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don't usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I'm flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn't help that he's buddy-buddy with my brother and that his best friend has a crush on me. Oh, did I not mention we're roommates? Fitzy has made it clear he's not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I'm not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I'm not about to start. I've got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he's missing, he knows where to find me.</p>

<h4>The Risk</h4>
<p>Everyone says I'm a bad girl. They're only partly right—I don't let fear rule me, and I certainly don't care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar's head hockey coach, I'd be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team, and that's who Jake Connelly is. Harvard's star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn't making it easy for me. I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend. For every fake date, he wants a real one, which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it's getting harder and harder to resist...</p>

But fate is cruel-I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn't making it easy for me. I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend. For every fake date...he wants a real one. Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it's getting harder and harder to resist Jake's oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him. That's the one risk I'm not willing to take. The Play What I learned after last year's distractions cost my hockey team our entire season? No more screwing up. No more screwing, period. As the new team captain, I need a new philosophy: hockey and school now, women later. Which means that I, Hunter Davenport, am officially going celibate...no matter how hard that makes things. But there's nothing in the rulebook that says I can't be friends with a woman. And I won't lie-my new classmate Demi Davis is one cool chick. Her smart mouth is hot as hell, and so is the rest of her, but the fact that she's got a boyfriend eliminates the temptation to touch her. Except three months into our friendship, Demi is single and looking for a rebound. And she's making a play for me. Avoiding her is impossible. We're paired up on a yearlong school project, but I'm confident I can resist her. We'd never work, anyway. Our backgrounds are too different, our goals aren't aligned, and her parents hate my guts. Hooking up is a very bad idea. Now I just have to convince my body-and my heart. The Dare College was supposed to be my chance to get over my ugly-duckling complex and spread my wings. Instead, I wound up in a sorority full of mean girls. I already have a hard time fitting in, so when my Kappa Chi sisters issue the challenge, I can't say no. The dare: seduce the hottest new hockey player in the junior class. Conor Edwards is a regular at Greek Row parties...and in Greek Row sorority beds. He's the one you fall for before you learn that guys like him don't give girls like me a second glance. Except Mr. Popular throws me for a loop-rather than laughing in my face, he does me a solid by letting me take him upstairs to pretend we're getting busy. Even crazier, now he wants to keep pretending. Turns out Conor loves games, and he thinks it's fun to pull the wool over my frenemies' eyes. But resisting his easy charm and surfer-boy hotness is darn near impossible. Though I'm realizing there's much more to Conor's story than his fan club can see. And the longer this silly ruse goes on, the greater the danger of it all blowing up in my face.","","","","","9.78035E+12","en","","","Hachette UK","","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

A Photo Finish 3. The Front Runner 4. A False Start Description: Off to the Races Keeping things professional with my employees has never been an issue . . . until Billie waltzes onto my property. Sheâ€™s talented, feisty and so damn tempting. We clash from the moment we meet, and I can't stop thinking about all the ways I could take her down a peg. I can't stop thinking about her, period. And in a small town, on an even smaller farm, itâ€™s hard to keep my distance. Billie is the whole package: whip-smart with a body I fantasise about, and quite possibly the only woman who can save this business â€“ and me. She drives me crazy, but the more time we spend together, the more I crave her: her lips, her trust, her heart . . . I want it all. But at what cost? Because suddenly I donâ€™t just want to win races, I want to win the girl. A Photo Finish Iâ€™ve seen every square inch of Violet Eatonâ€™s delectable body and she has no idea who I am. Until now. What happened between us online, in our chats, was meant to stay anonymous and in the past. Until it didnâ€™t. Itâ€™s a small world, but Ruby Creek is even smaller. When I move to the tiny town, the grumpy facade Iâ€™ve created slips when weâ€™re forced to live under the same roof. Every time her eyes flare with heat, every time she begs me not to stop, the ice Iâ€™ve encased myself in melts. She has me wanting things I canâ€™t want â€“ things I donâ€™t deserve. But my invisible wounds have the power to ruin us both. As a former soldier, I should have the discipline to walk away, but the more I open up to Violet, the more I want to keep her. I came back from the war a different man, but my scars are older and deeper than anyone knows â€“ and I planned to keep it that way. I planned to keep my secrets hidden. Until her. The Front Runner Stefan Dalca is infuriatingly handsome and annoyingly persistent. Weâ€™re supposed to hate each other, but apparently he didnâ€™t get the memo, because heâ€™s been asking me out for years. And I always say no. Until today. Today he has something that I desperately need â€“ today, heâ€™s my saviour. Our time together starts out as a simple transaction: three dates, no touching, no telling anyone â€“ and definitely no falling in love. But with every intimate conversation, and each stolen glance, the tension between us builds. The way he looks at me gives me butterflies. And when he finally touches me? We sizzle. Stefan makes me feel seen in a way no other person has before. He cherishes my words as passionately as my body. He makes me laugh, he makes me blush. Heâ€™s not the villain heâ€™s been made out to be. And suddenly I find myself longing for him in a way the people closest to me wouldnâ€™t approve of or understand. Giving in to Stefan Dalca is playing with fire. But with him I donâ€™t even mind the heat. A False Start I kissed my best friendâ€™s little sister, and the world stood still. That night we were two perfect strangers, the townâ€™s grumpy recluse and a gorgeous girl in the back of a bar. Until we werenâ€™t. Because Nadia Dalca isnâ€™t just some girl, sheâ€™s the girl I canâ€™t have. Fourteen years younger than me and completely off-limits. My plan is to stay away, but the universe keeps pushing us together. Itâ€™s like some sort of cosmic joke, to give me a taste of something so electric â€“ so real â€“ that breathed life back into me. Because I can look, but I canâ€™t touch. Her sinful curves, her light-hearted laughter, her wild sideâ€¦ Iâ€™m addicted to every last bit of her. And when she turns those sultry eyes on me, so full of longing and free of judgement? Iâ€™ve always considered myself a strong man but, when she looks at me, Iâ€™m weak. To give in to our connection would be a betrayal. Her brother is the only family she has left and, sad as it sounds, heâ€™s also my only friend. But I kissed her again anyway. And now I canâ€™t stop.","","","","","9.78011E+12","en","","","Simon & Schuster","","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? : The Best of the SF Masterworks</p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Philip K Dick</p>

<p>World War Terminus devastated the Earth. Through its ruins, bounty hunter Rick Deckard searches for the renegade replicants he is sent to 'retire', while he dreams of owning a live animal - the ultimate status symbol in a world nearly devoid of natural life.</p>

<p>The opportunity of a lifetime: kill six Nexus-6 targets for a huge reward. But in Deckard's world, things aren't that simple, and his assignment turns into a nightmare kaleidoscope of subterfuge and deceit - where the hunter becomes the hunted.</p>

<p>Voted in a Locus poll as one of the 100 pre-1990 SF Novels, <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em> inspired two blockbuster movies. Philip K. Dick won multiple awards for his works, exploring human identity, psychology, conspiracy, and paranoia, challenging the notion of objective truth in a way that remains relevant today.</p>

Through its ruins, bounty hunter Rick Deckard searches for the renegade replicants he is sent to 'retire', while he dreams of owning a live animal - the ultimate status symbol in a world all but bereft of natural life. The opportunity of a lifetime: kill six Nexus-6 targets, for a huge reward. But in Deckard's world things aren't that simple, and his assignment turns into a nightmare kaleidoscope of subterfuge and deceit - and the hunter becomes the hunted . . . Voted in a Locus poll as one of the 100 pre-1990 SF Novels, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep spawned two blockbuster movies. Philip K. Dick won multiple awards for his works, examining human identity, psychology, conspiracy and paranoia, challenging the idea of objective truth in a manner that remains relevant today.

<h2>Rebel Folklore: Empowering Tales of Spirits, Witches and Other Misfits from Anansi to Baba Yaga</h2>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Icy Sedgwick</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Rebel Folklore gathers 50 of the darkest and most complicated folktale characters from around the world, highlighting the importance of rebels and misfits in ancient stories. These folktales, passed down through generations by those on society's fringes—women, peasants, and outcasts—offer a rich tapestry of human experience.</p>
<p>These ancient narratives are filled with strange characters and complex figures that reflect the world that created them. From outspoken women labeled as witches to anti-authority figures branded as criminals, flawed heroes to relatable villains, <em>Rebel Folklore</em> celebrates 50 of these misfits and their relevance today.</p>
<p>Whether it's Muma Padurii, the Romanian forest witch who protects the environment by terrorizing trespassers, the Churel, who stalks unfaithful men on her backwards feet, or Robin Hood, the beloved lawless activist, we can learn valuable lessons from these historical rebels: how to speak out, embrace our flaws, and unapologetically be ourselves—even if that means being a cannibalistic swamp witch.</p>

"9780008529529","These Infinite Threads by Tahereh Mafi","
<p>
    Full of explosive magic, searing romance, and heartbreaking betrayal, <strong>These Infinite Threads</strong> is the breathtaking sequel to the instant New York Times and Sunday Times bestseller <em>This Woven Kingdom</em>.
</p>
<p>
    With the heat of a kiss, the walls between Alizeh, the long-lost heir to an ancient Jinn kingdom, and Kamran, the crown prince of the Ardunian empire, have crumbled. And so have both of their lives. Kamran’s grandfather, the king of Ardunia, lays dead, the terrible secret of his deal with the devil exposed to the world.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus, the mysterious copper-haired royal, has stolen Alizeh away to Tulan, the neighboring kingdom where he rules. Cyrus has made his own deal with the devil—one that would require Alizeh to betray her feelings for Kamran if she’s to reclaim the Jinn throne. Alizeh wants nothing to do with Cyrus or his deal with Iblees. But with no means of escaping Tulan, and the tantalizing promise of fulfilling her destiny as the heir to the Jinn, she’s forced to wonder whether she can set aside her emotions—and finally become the queen her people need.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, Kamran is picking up the pieces of his broken kingdom. Facing betrayal at every turn, all he knows for certain is that he must go to Tulan to avenge his grandfather. He can only hope that Alizeh will be waiting for him there—and that she’s not yet become queen of Tulan.

<p><strong>Now a Netflix Series!</strong> <em>An Irish Times Bestseller</em></p>
<p>When a tragic accident leads Jackie to move into a house filled with twelve boys, she gets far more than she ever expected. This sweet YA romance is perfect for fans of Kasie West and Jenny Han—and is one of the most beloved Wattpad books ever!</p>
<p>Moving in with twelve boys was not part of the plan. Jackie's goal is perfection—perfect grades, the perfect look, getting into the perfect school. If she can achieve that, then maybe her too-busy mom and dad will take notice. But when her parents die in a tragic accident, Jackie is shipped off across the country to live with the Walters, her new guardians—who just happen to have twelve sons (well, eleven, but their daughter, Parker, is basically one of the boys).</p>
<p>The Walter boys are loud, dirty, annoying—and, okay, some of the older boys might be Greek god level hot, but they don't think a city girl belongs on their horse ranch. How is Jackie supposed to fit into their chaotic world when she needs to keep her parents' memory alive by living up to the promise of perfect?</p>
<p>But as Jackie spends more time with the Walter boys, she begins to wonder if the perfection she's always strived for isn't the only way to find love after all.</p>
<p>Funny and moving, <strong>My Life with the Walter Boys</strong> is perfect for readers looking for:</p>

<h1>King of Greed: The Instant Sunday Times Bestseller</h1>
<h2>Fall into a world of addictive romance . . . by Ana Huang</h2>

<p>Meet the <strong>Kings of Sin</strong> . . . The must-read billionaire romance from the bestselling author of the Twisted series. <em>'Get ready for all the spice, all the build-up and all the sizzling tension'</em> - GLAMOUR</p>

<p>Read <strong>King of Greed</strong> now for a steamy marriage in crisis romance. He had her, he lost her . . . and he'll do anything to win her back. Powerful, brilliant, and ambitious, Dominic Davenport clawed his way up from nothing to become the <strong>King of Wall Street</strong>. He has everything - a beautiful home, a beautiful wife, and more money than he could spend in a lifetime. But no matter how much he accumulates, he's never satisfied. In his endless quest for more, he drives away the only person who saw him as enough. It isn't until she's gone that he realizes there may be more to life than riches and glory . . . but by then, it may be too late.</p>

<p><strong>Kind, intelligent, and thoughtful</strong>, Alessandra Davenport has played the role of trophy wife for years. She stood by her husband while he built an empire, but now that they've reached the top, she realizes he's no longer the man she fell for. When it becomes clear that she'll always come second to his work, she finally takes charge of her life and puts herself first - even if it means leaving the only man she's ever loved. But what she didn't count on was his refusal to let her go . . . or for him to fight for their marriage, no matter what it takes.</p>

<p><strong>King of Greed</strong> is a steamy marriage in trouble billionaire romance. It includes explicit content and profanity. <strong>Recommended for mature readers only.</strong></p>

        <p>“Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognizes before it can speak. But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words.

<h1>The Right Move: Windy City Book 2</h1>
<h2>by Liz Tomforde</h2>
<p>Discover the #BookTok sports romance series everyone is talking about.</p>

<h3>RYAN</h3>
<p>She's a distraction, that's what she is. I'm the newest Captain of the Devils, Chicago's NBA team, and the last thing I needed this year was for Indy Ivers, my sister's best friend, to move into my apartment. She's messy, emotional, and way too tempting. But when the team's General Manager vocalizes his blatant disapproval of my promotion to Captain, referring to me as an unapproachable lone wolf with no work-life balance, I can't think of a better way to convince him otherwise than pretending to date my outgoing roommate. The only problem? Faking it feels far too natural. Having a fake girlfriend wasn't supposed to be messy but having Indy under my roof and in my bed is complicated, especially when she wants all the romantic parts of life that I could never give her.</p>

<h3>INDY</h3>
<p>I never imagined I'd be living with my best friend's brother, NBA superstar Ryan Shay. Even more unbelievable? He needs me to act as his loving girlfriend who's suddenly changed him into a friendly and approachable guy. Because, well . . . he's not. He's controlling of his space and untrusting of others. Our arrangement isn't one-sided, though. I'm in a wedding coming up, one where every one of my childhood friends, including my ex-boyfriend, will be in attendance, and there's no better date than my ex's celebrity hero. Blurred lines make it almost impossible to separate real from fake. Falling for my roommate was never part of the deal, especially when Ryan is quick to remind me that he doesn't believe in love. I'm a romantic and can't help fantasizing that he'll change, but soon enough, I find myself questioning if sharing a roof with my best friend's brother was the right move after all . . .</p>

    <h3>Loki: A Bad God's Guide to Being Good</h3>
    <p>After one trick too many, Loki is banished to live on Earth as a ""normal"" school boy. Forbidden from using his AWESOME godly powers, Loki must show moral improvement. As he records his lies in his magical (judgemental) diary, it becomes clear Loki hasn’t a clue how to tell good from evil, trust from tricks, or friends from enemies.</p>

    <h3>Loki: A Bad God's Guide to Taking the Blame</h3>
    <p>Odin has given Loki another chance to prove himself worthy of Asgard. But earning everyone’s trust is tricky, and when Thor’s hammer goes missing, everyone blames Loki! To clear his name he must: 
        <ol>
            <li>Find Thor’s beloved hammer</li>
            <li>Uncover the real thief</li>

    <h3>Loki: A Bad God's Guide to Ruling the World</h3>
    <p>When Heimdall and Hyrrokkin abandon their ""children"" to go on holiday, Odin sends Baldur – Thor's half brother and god of making Loki look bad – to babysit. As Baldur and Thor bond, Loki's attempts to prove he's good start getting desperate. After being cast as the villain in the school play, Loki wonders whether there's any point in being good when everyone seems convinced of his villainy. That is until he discovers a rather unusual ring among the costumes and props, one that promises Loki the world if only he gives in to his deepest, darkest desires...</p>

    <h3>Loki: A Bad God's Guide to Making Enemies</h3>
    <p>Loki has made a fair few enemies during his time in Asgard. When the elf, Vinir beams Loki aboard his chariot and challenges him to a magical duel, Loki hasn't got a clue why. Sweet talking his way out of a fight by pointing out there's little honour in duelling someone who can't remember how they wronged you, Loki is returned safely to school. That is until Vinir shows up in child form, as resolute as ever about seeking that duel... and vengeance.</p>

To clear his name he must: 1) Find Thorâ€™s beloved hammer 2) Uncover the real thief 3) Force everyone to admit they were wrong An easy feat for someone as handsome and clever as Lokiâ€¦ Loki: A Bad God's Guide to Ruling the World When Heimdall and Hyrrokkin abandon their ""children"" to go on holiday, Odin sends Baldur â€“ Thor's half brother and god of making Loki look bad â€“ to babysit. As Baldur and Thor bond, Loki's attempts to prove he's good start getting a bit desperate. After the drama teacher casts him as the villain in the school play, Loki starts to wonder whether there's any point in being good when everyone seems convinced of his villainy. That is until he discovers a rather unusual ring among the costumes and props. A ring that looks suspiciously like the cursed ring of Andvari, one that promises Loki the world if only he gives in to his deepest, darkest desires... Loki: A Bad God's Guide to Making Enemies Loki has made a fair few enemies during his time in Asgard. Too many to count and certainly too many to remember. When the elf, Vinir beams Loki aboard his chariot and challenges him to a magical duel, Loki hasn't got a clue why. Sweet talking his way out of a fight by pointing out there's little honour in duelling someone who can't remember how they wronged you, and even less in picking on a child, Loki is returned safely to school. That is until Vinir shows up in child form, as resolute as ever about seeking that duel... and vengeance.","","","","","9.78068E+12","en","","","Walker Books Ltd","Age_9-14, Black Friday Sale, Boxing Day, newsletter, Summer reads, The Week Junior Book Awards, wf-top-50-recently-restocked","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

    <h5>The Plant Paradox (Hardback)</h5>
    <p>From renowned cardiac surgeon Steven R. Gundry, MD, <em>The Plant Paradox</em> is a revolutionary look at the hidden compounds in ""healthy"" foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that are causing weight gain and chronic disease. Most of us have heard of gluten—a protein in wheat that causes inflammation. But what if we’ve been missing the root of the problem? Dr. Gundry reveals that gluten is just one type of a common, toxic plant-based protein called lectin.</p>
    
    <p>Lectins are found in grains, as well as in many foods we consider healthy, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and conventional dairy products. These proteins, found in the seeds, skins, and leaves of plants, are designed to protect them from predators, including humans. Once ingested, they incite chemical warfare in our bodies, causing inflammatory reactions that can lead to weight gain and serious health conditions.</p>
    
    <p>At his clinics in California, Dr. Gundry has treated thousands of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, diabetes, leaky gut syndrome, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases with a protocol that detoxes cells, repairs the gut, and nourishes the body. Now, he shares this clinically proven program with readers worldwide.</p>
    
    <p>Lectins are everywhere, but Dr. Gundry offers simple hacks to avoid them, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peel your veggies:</strong> Most lectins are in the skin and seeds; peeling and de-seeding reduces their content.</li>
        <li><strong>Shop for fruit in season:</strong> Ripe fruits contain fewer lectins, so eat them at peak ripeness.</li>
        <li><strong>Swap brown rice for white:</strong> Whole grains with hard coatings cause digestive distress and are full of lectins.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With a full list of lectin-containing foods, substitutes, a step-by-step detox plan, and delicious lectin-free recipes, <em>The Plant Paradox</em> illuminates the hidden dangers in your salad bowl and shows you how to eat whole foods in a new way.</p>

The Plant Paradox (Hardback) 2. The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy (Paperback) Description: The Plant Paradox (Hardback) From renowned cardiac surgeon Steven R. Gundry, MD The Plant Paradox is a revolutionary look at the hidden compounds in ""healthy"" foods like fruit, vegetables, and whole grains that are causing us to gain weight and develop chronic disease. Most of us have heard of glutenâ€”a protein found in wheat that causes widespread inflammation in the body. Americans spend billions of dollars on gluten-free diets in an effort to protect their health. But what if weâ€™ve been missing the root of the problem? In The Plant Paradox , renowned cardiologist Dr. Steven Gundry reveals that gluten is just one variety of a common, and highly toxic, plant-based protein called lectin. Lectins are found not only in grains like wheat but also in the â€œgluten-freeâ€ foods most of us commonly regard as healthy, including many fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and conventional dairy products. These proteins, which are found in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves of plants, are designed by nature to protect them from predators (including humans). Once ingested, they incite a kind of chemical warfare in our bodies, causing inflammatory reactions that can lead to weight gain and serious health conditions. At his waitlist-only clinics in California, Dr. Gundry has successfully treated tens of thousands of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, diabetes, leaky gut syndrome, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases with a protocol that detoxes the cells, repairs the gut, and nourishes the body. Now, in The Plant Paradox , he shares this clinically proven program with readers around the world. The simple (and daunting) fact is, lectins are everywhere. Thankfully, Dr. Gundry offers simple hacks we easily can employ to avoid them, including: Peel your veggies. Most of the lectins are contained in the skin and seeds of plants; simply peeling and de-seeding vegetables (like tomatoes and peppers) reduces their lectin content. Shop for fruit in season. Fruit contain fewer lectins when ripe, so eating apples, berries, and other lectin-containing fruits at the peak of ripeness helps minimize your lectin consumption. Swap your brown rice for white. Whole grains and seeds with hard outer coatings are designed by nature to cause digestive distressâ€”and are full of lectins. With a full list of lectin-containing foods and simple substitutes for each, a step-by-step detox and eating plan, and delicious lectin-free recipes, The Plant Paradox illuminates the hidden dangers lurking in your salad bowlâ€”and shows you how to eat whole foods in a whole new way. The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy (Paperback) The 30-Day Plan to Lose Weight, Feel Great, and Live Lectin-Free. In Dr. Steven Gundryâ€™s breakout bestseller The Plant Paradox, readers learned the surprising truth about foods that have long been regarded as healthy. Lectinsâ€”a type of protein found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, dairy, and grainsâ€”wreak havoc on the gut, creating systemic inflammation and laying the groundwork for disease and weight gain. Avoiding lectins offers incredible health benefits but requires a significant lifestyle changeâ€”one that, for many people, can feel overwhelming. Now, in The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy, Dr. Gundry makes it simpler than ever to go lectin free. His 30-day challenge offers incentives, support, and results along with a toolkit for success. With grocery lists, meal plans, time-saving cooking strategies, all-new recipes, and guidance for families and those following specialized diets (including ketogenic and vegan), The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy is the all-in-one resource Plant Paradox fans and newcomers alike need to jumpstart results reap the health benefits of living lectin-free.","","","","","9.78912E+12","en","","","HarperCollins Publishers","Black Friday Sale, Boxing Day, EXPORT, Genre_Children's & young adult: general non-fiction, Non-Fiction","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

<h1>To Kill A Mockingbird 60th Anniversary Edition</h1>
<h2>by Harper Lee</h2>
<p><strong>“Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.”</strong></p>
<p>A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man falsely charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s.</p>
<p>The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.</p>
<p><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression, and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.</p>

Only one of them will be chosen as a scythe's apprentice and as Citra and Rowan come up against a terrifyingly corrupt Scythedom, it becomes clear that the winning apprentice's first task will be to glean the loser.; 448 pages; Published: 01/02/2018","","","","","9.78141E+12","en","","","Walker Books Ltd","Author_Neal Shusterman, Binding_Paperback, Extended Range, Genre_Romance & relationships stories (Children's / Teenage), Imprint_Walker Books Ltd, Series_Arc of a Scythe","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

    <h1>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Mildred D. Taylor</p>
    <p><strong>Series:</strong> Puffin Modern Classics - A Puffin Book</p>
    <p>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is a classic story of a girl growing up in the deep South. Set in Mississippi during the American Depression, it narrates a family's struggle to maintain their integrity, pride, and independence against a cruelly racist society.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“We have no choice of what colour we're born or who our parents are or whether we're rich or poor. What we do have is some choice over what we make of our lives once we're here.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Mississippi of the 1930s was a challenging environment for a black child. Cassie, the protagonist, learns the significance of her father's desire to farm their own land amidst the hatred and destruction inflicted by night riders. Throughout that year, she discovers the profound differences that divide them and the importance of fighting for principles, even at great personal cost.</p>
    <p><strong>About the Author:</strong> Mildred D. Taylor was born in Mississippi and raised in Ohio. She served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia before studying journalism at the University of Colorado, where she contributed to a Black Studies program. She is best known for her Newbery Medal-winning book, <em>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</em>, and currently resides in Colorado.</p>

'We have no choice of what colour we're born or who our parents are or whether we're rich or poor.

    <p>This fabulous picture book from superstar author and illustrator Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler is a riot of slapstick fun and silliness. The Baddies are the meanest, nastiest ghost, witch, and troll in the land. They just adore being bad and fight over who is the worst.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Perfect read-aloud rhyming text</li>

    <h5>Icebreaker</h5>
    <p>Sparks fly when a competitive figure skater and hockey team captain are forced to share a rink. Anastasia Allen has worked her entire life for a shot at Team USA. It looks like everything is going according to plan when she gets a full scholarship to the University of California, Maple Hills and lands a place on their competitive figure skating team. Nothing will stand in her way, not even the captain of the hockey team, Nate Hawkins. Nate’s focus as team captain is on keeping his team on the ice. Which is tricky when a facilities mishap means they are forced to share a rink with the figure skating team—including Anastasia, who clearly can’t stand him. But when Anastasia’s skating partner faces an uncertain future, she may have to look to Nate to take her shot. Sparks fly, but Anastasia isn’t worried… because she could never like a hockey player, right?</p>
    
    <h5>Wildfire</h5>
    <p>When Russ and Aurora cross paths at a university party, a drinking game ends with them spending the night together. The next day, Aurora slips away before Russ learns her full name. This anonymity ends when they both turn up to their first day of work as camp counsellors. A job they had both chosen to escape Maple Hills for the summer. Given their history, there’s still an obvious tension between the two but the camp has a strict “no staff fraternizing” rule. Russ doesn’t want to risk heading home early but Aurora has never been one for rules. As things heat up, they'll have to resist or risk starting something they just can’t stop.</p>
    
    <h5>Daydream</h5>
    <p>As a chronic procrastinator, Henry Turner always knew his junior year in college wasn’t going to be easy. That was before he made ice hockey captain as well as landing himself in a difficult class with his least favourite professor. Thankfully, it’s then that Henry meets Halle, a fellow junior who he immediately befriends. Academic pressure has never been a struggle for Halle, but as an introverted people pleaser with a tendency to overcommit herself, she can’t help but offer to help Henry pass his class. In turn he offers to help make college life a little more inspiring – just the thing she needs as an aspiring novelist… Failure isn’t an option for either of them but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a little room for distraction…</p>

<h1>The Mousehole Cat</h1>
<p>A picture book favourite, this is the dramatic and moving Cornish tale of a cat and a fisherman who brave the stormy seas to save their village. This stunningly illustrated story takes place in the seaside village of Mousehole, Cornwall, where Mowzer the cat lives happily with old fisherman Tom. Tom rocks the rocking chair just right and catches fresh fish for dinner every night.</p>
<p>Their life is a happy one—until one terrible winter, when the Great Storm-Cat comes clawing, snarling, and leaping at the harbour walls, preventing any boats from going out to sea to fish. Soon, with Christmas approaching, there is no food left in Mousehole.</p>
<p>It is then that Mowzer and Tom set out to brave the fury of the waves together, discovering that it might just take a cat's perspective to understand—and tame—the ferocious ways of the Great Storm-Cat sea.</p>
<p>Gently yet powerfully told, this incredibly moving story of bravery, sacrifice, and companionship, inspired by Cornish legend, is sure to connect with readers of all ages, both new and old alike.</p>

It is then that Mowzer and Tom set out to brave the fury of the waves together, and discover that it might just need a cat's perspective to understand - and tame - the ferocious ways of the Great Storm-Cat sea... Gently yet powerfully told, this incredibly moving story of bravery, sacrifice and companionship inspired by Cornish legend is sure to connect with readers of all ages, new and old alike.","","","","","9.78074E+12","en","","","Walker Books Ltd","Extended Range, Genre_Picture Books, Picture books","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

<h1>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</h1>
<h2>by Agatha Christie</h2>
<p>Agatha Christie's most daring crime mystery, <strong>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</strong>, features an early and particularly brilliant outing of Hercule Poirot. This novel, with its legendary twist, changed the detective fiction genre forever.</p>
<p>Roger Ackroyd knew too much. He was aware that the woman he loved had poisoned her brutal first husband and suspected that someone had been blackmailing her. Tragically, he received the news that she had taken her own life with a drug overdose. However, the evening post brought Roger one last fatal scrap of information. Unfortunately, before he could finish reading the letter, he was stabbed to death.</p>

    <p>A young woman is in love with a successful surgeon; a man torn between his love for her and his womanising. His mistress, a free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals; while her other lover stands to lose everything because of his noble qualities. In a world where lives are shaped by choices and events, and everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance and weight - and we feel 'the unbearable lightness of being'.</p>
    <p>The Unbearable Lightness of Being encompasses passion and philosophy, infidelity and ideas, the Prague Spring and modern America, political acts and private desires, comedy and tragedy - in fact, all of human existence.</p>

<h2>The Living Mountain: A Celebration of the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland</h2>
<h3>by Nan Shepherd</h3>
<p><strong>“The finest book ever written on nature and landscape in Britain”</strong> - Guardian</p>
<p><strong>Introduction by:</strong> Robert Macfarlane</p>
<p><strong>Afterword by:</strong> Jeanette Winterson</p>
<p>In this masterpiece of nature writing, Nan Shepherd describes her journeys into the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland. There, she encounters a world that can be breathtakingly beautiful at times and shockingly harsh at others. Her intense, poetic prose explores and records the rocks, rivers, creatures, and hidden aspects of this remarkable landscape.</p>
<p>Shepherd spent a lifetime in search of the 'essential nature' of the Cairngorms; her quest led her to write this classic meditation on the magnificence of mountains and our imaginative relationship with the wild world around us. Composed during the Second World War, the manuscript of <em>The Living Mountain</em> lay untouched for more than thirty years before it was finally published.</p>

Her intense, poetic prose explores and records the rocks, rivers, creatures and hidden aspects of this remarkable landscape. Shepherd spent a lifetime in search of the 'essential nature' of the Cairngorms; her quest led her to write this classic meditation on the magnificence of mountains, and on our imaginative relationship with the wild world around us. Composed during the Second World War, the manuscript of The Living Mountain lay untouched for more than thirty years before it was finally published.; 160 pages; Published: 18/08/2011","","","","","9.78086E+12","en","","","Canongate Books","Age_Adult, Author_Nan Shepherd, Binding_Paperback, Extended Range, Genre_Prose: non-fiction, Imprint_Canongate Canons, Non-Fiction, Series_Canons","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

    <h1>A Short History of Nearly Everything</h1>
    <h2>by Bill Bryson</h2>
    <p>The ultimate eye-opening journey through time and space, <strong>A Short History of Nearly Everything</strong> is the biggest-selling popular science book of the 21st century, with over 2 million copies sold.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>'Truly impressive...It's hard to imagine a better rough guide to science.' - <em>Guardian</em></p>
        <p>'A travelogue of science, with a witty, engaging, and well-informed guide.' - <em>The Times</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Bill Bryson, a self-described reluctant traveller, explores his curiosity about the world around him. This book is his quest to understand everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization—how we transitioned from nothing at all to being us.</p>
    <p>His challenge is to make subjects that typically bore most of us, like geology, chemistry, and particle physics, comprehensible and engaging for those who never thought they could be interested in science. As a result, <strong>A Short History of Nearly Everything</strong> reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.</p>

'Truly impressive...It's hard to imagine a better rough guide to science.' Guardian 'A travelogue of science, with a witty, engaging, and well-informed guide' The Times Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller, but even when he stays safely at home he can't contain his curiosity about the world around him. A Short History of Nearly Everything is his quest to understand everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill Bryson's challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science. As a result, A Short History of Nearly Everything reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.; 672 pages; Published: 16/06/2016","","","","","9.78178E+12","en","","","Transworld Publishers Ltd","Age_Adult, Author_Bill Bryson, Binding_Paperback, Extended Range, Genre_Popular science, Imprint_Black Swan, Non-Fiction, Series_Bryson","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

<h1>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</h1>
<h2>by Cal Newport</h2>
<p>Many modern knowledge workers spend most of their brain power battling distraction and interruption, whether due to the incessant pinging of devices, noisy open-plan offices, or the difficulty of deciding what deserves your attention the most.</p>
<p>When Cal Newport coined the term <strong>'deep work'</strong> on his popular blog, <em>Study Hacks</em>, in 2012, he found the concept quickly hit a nerve. Most of us are excruciatingly familiar with shallow work instead—distractedly skimming the surface of our workload and never getting to the important part.</p>
<p>Newport began exploring the methods and mindset that foster a practice of distraction-free productivity at work. In <strong>DEEP WORK</strong>, he shows how anyone can achieve this elusive state. Through revealing portraits of both historical and modern-day thinkers, academics, and leaders in technology, science, and culture, Newport shares an inspiring collection of tools to maximize your intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>He explains why mastering this shift in work practices is crucial for anyone who intends to stay ahead in a complex information economy and how to systematically train the mind to focus. Put simply, developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions we can make in an increasingly distracted world.</p>

<h1>Just Kids by Patti Smith</h1>
<p><strong>Winner of the 2010 Non-Fiction National Book Award</strong></p>
<p>Patti Smith's definitive memoir is an evocative, honest, and moving coming-of-age story of her extraordinary relationship with the artist Robert Mapplethorpe.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>'Sharp, elegiac and finely crafted'</em> - Sunday Times</p>
    <p><em>'Terrifically evocative ... The most spellbinding and diverting portrait of funky-but-chic New York in the late '60s and '70s that any alumnus has committed to print'</em> - New York Times</p>
    <p><em>'Render, harrowing, often hilarious'</em> - Vogue</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1967, a chance meeting between two young people led to a romance and a lifelong friendship that would carry each to international success never dreamed of. The backdrop is Brooklyn, Chelsea Hotel, Max's Kansas City, Scribner's Bookstore, Coney Island, Warhol's Factory, and the whole city resplendent.</p>
<p>Among their friends were literary lights, musicians, and artists such as Harry Smith, Bobby Neuwirth, Allen Ginsberg, Sandy Daley, Sam Shepherd, and William Burroughs. It was a heightened time politically and culturally; the art and music worlds exploding and colliding.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, two kids made a pact to always care for one another. Scrappy, romantic, and committed to making art, they prodded and provided each other with faith and confidence during the hungry years—the days of cous-cous and lettuce soup.</p>
<p><strong>Just Kids</strong> begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. Beautifully written, this is a profound portrait of two young artists, often hungry, sated only by art and experience. It is an unforgettable portrait of New York, her rich and poor, hustlers and hellions, those who made it and those whose memory lingers near.</p>

    <h2>The Goldfinch</h2>
    <h3>by Donna Tartt</h3>
    <p><strong>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2014</strong></p>
    <p>Aged thirteen, Theo Decker, son of a devoted mother and a reckless, largely absent father, survives an accident that otherwise tears his life apart. Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal underworld.</p>
    <p>As he grows up, Theo learns to glide between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love - and his talisman, the painting, places him at the centre of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.</p>
    <p><strong>The Goldfinch</strong> is a haunted odyssey through present-day America and a drama of enthralling power. Combining unforgettably vivid characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive triumph - a sweeping story of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries of love, identity and fate.</p>

<h1>Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed or Fail</h1>
<h2>Author: Ray Dalio</h2>
<p>From legendary investor <strong>Ray Dalio</strong>, author of the international bestseller <em>Principles</em>, who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, <strong>Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order</strong> examines history's most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we've experienced in our lifetimes - but similar to those that have happened many times before.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Ray Dalio noticed a confluence of political and economic conditions he hadn't encountered before. These included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates leading to massive printing of money in the world's three major reserve currencies.</li>
    <li>Significant political and social conflicts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in over 100 years.</li>
    <li>The rise of a world power (China) challenging the existing world power (US) and the current world order.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last time this confluence occurred was between 1930 and 1945. This realization sent Dalio on a search for the repeating patterns and cause/effect relationships underlying all major changes in wealth and power over the last 500 years.</p>
<p>In this remarkable and timely addition to his <em>Principles</em> series, Dalio brings readers along for his study of major empires - including the Dutch, the British, and the American - putting into perspective the 'Big Cycle' that has driven the successes and failures of all the world's major countries throughout history.</p>
<p>Dalio reveals the timeless and universal forces behind these shifts and uses them to look into the future, offering practical principles for positioning oneself for what's ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Wuthering Heights</strong> is often labeled as ""romantic,"" but a deeper reading reveals the extremes of physical and psychological violence. As Jeanette Winterson notes, this novel is a masterpiece of intense, unsettling power.</p>

John Yorke, creator of the BBC Writers' Academy, has brought a vast array of drama to British screens.

    <p>From ancient myths to big-budget blockbusters, he gets to the root of the stories that are all around us, every day.</p>

    <p>A word-of-mouth bestseller, <em>Raising Boys</em> has become one of the most beloved and successful books in the parenting field. This expanded edition includes around 20% new material, featuring startling new research on what helps—and what harms—boys.</p>
    <p>Steve Biddulph shares practical and honest advice for parents to recognize the different stages of boyhood and learn how to raise happy, confident, and kind young men.

Unfortunately, home, society, and education have often failed boys, leading to unhappy men who struggle to become responsible, emotionally-confident adults.</p>
    <p>While it is essential for boys to learn about manhood from their fathers, this updated classic also provides valuable insights for mothers and single mothers raising baby boys.</p>
    <h3>Key Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>How ADHD may be caused by stress in the first year of life.</li>
        <li>Whether boys should start school later than girls.</li>
        <li>The importance of allowing boys to cry, which can help prevent violence, suicide, and risky behavior.</li>
        <li>Two new stages of boyhood: the FULL ON FOURS and the EMOTIONAL EIGHTS.</li>
        <li>Support for single mothers raising sons.</li>
        <li>Choosing a sport that benefits rather than harms.</li>
        <li>Addressing boys and binge drinking.</li>
        <li>Insights from science on teenage boys and driving, and how to keep our sons safe.</li>

"9781787702691","The Story of the Lost Child by Elena Ferrante","
<h1>The Story of the Lost Child</h1>
<h2>by Elena Ferrante</h2>
<p><em>Nothing quite like this has ever been published before,</em> proclaimed <strong>The Guardian</strong> about the Neapolitan novels in 2014. Against the backdrop of a Naples that is as seductive as it is perilous and a world undergoing epochal change, Elena Ferrante tells the story of a lifelong friendship between two women with unmatched honesty and brilliance.</p>
<p><strong>The Story of the Lost Child</strong> is the concluding volume in the dazzling saga of two women—the brilliant, bookish Elena, and the fiery, uncontainable Lila. Both are now adults, with husbands, lovers, aging parents, and children. Their friendship has been the gravitational center of their lives.</p>
<p>Both women fought to escape the neighborhood in which they grew up—a prison of conformity, violence, and inviolable taboos. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received books. In this final novel, she has returned to Naples, drawn back as if responding to the city's obscure magnetism.</p>
<p>Lila, on the other hand, could never free herself from the city of her birth. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity with the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect the neighborhood. Proximity to the world she has always rejected only brings her role as its unacknowledged leader into relief. For Lila is unstoppable, unmanageable, unforgettable.</p>
<p>The four volumes in this series constitute a long remarkable story that readers will return to again and again, and each return will bring with it new revelations.</p>

<div class=""book-description"">
    <h2>The Myth of Sisyphus</h2>
    <h3>by Albert Camus</h3>
    <p>
        The summation of the existentialist philosophy threaded throughout all his writing, 
        <strong>Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus</strong> is translated by Justin O'Brien 
        with an introduction by James Wood in Penguin Classics. In this profound and moving 
        philosophical statement, Camus poses the fundamental question: <em>is life worth living?</em> 
        If human existence holds no significance, what can keep us from suicide? As Camus argues, 
        if there is no God to give meaning to our lives, humans must take on that purpose themselves. 
        This is our 'absurd' task, like Sisyphus forever rolling his rock up a hill, as the 
        inevitability of death constantly overshadows us.

        Written during the bleakest days of the Second World War, <strong>The Myth of Sisyphus</strong> 
        (Le Mythe de Sisyphe) argues for an acceptance of reality that encompasses revolt, passion 
        and, above all, liberty. This volume contains several other essays, including lyrical 
        evocations of the sunlit cities of Algiers and Oran, the settings of his great novels 
        <em>The Outsider</em> and <em>The Plague</em>.

        <strong>Albert Camus</strong> (1913-60) is the author of a number of best-selling and highly 
        influential works, all of which are published by Penguin. They include <em>The Fall</em>, 
        <em>The Outsider</em> and <em>The First Man</em>. Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, 
        Camus is remembered as one of the few writers to have shaped the intellectual climate of 
        post-war France, but beyond that, his fame has been international.

        If you enjoyed <strong>The Myth of Sisyphus</strong>, you might like Camus' <em>The Outsider</em>,

In this profound and moving philosophical statement, Camus poses the fundamental question: is life worth living? If human existence holds no significance, what can keep us from suicide? As Camus argues, if there is no God to give meaning to our lives, humans must take on that purpose themselves. This is our 'absurd' task, like Sisyphus forever rolling his rock up a hill, as the inevitability of death constantly overshadows us. Written during the bleakest days of the Second World War, The Myth of Sisyphus (Le Mythe de Sisyphe) argues for an acceptance of reality that encompasses revolt, passion and, above all, liberty.

<h1>Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</h1>
<h2>by Nick Bostrom</h2>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy & Oxford Martin</p>
<p>The human brain possesses unique capabilities that set it apart from other animals, granting our species a dominant position. While other animals may have stronger muscles or sharper claws, we have more advanced cognitive abilities. If machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, this superintelligence could wield significant power. Just as the fate of gorillas now relies on human actions, our future may hinge on the decisions made by machine superintelligence.</p>
<p>However, we have an advantage: we can make the first move. Is it possible to create a seed AI or engineer initial conditions to ensure a survivable intelligence explosion? How can we achieve a controlled detonation? To explore these questions, we must navigate a complex landscape of topics and considerations.</p>
<p>In this book, you will discover:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oracles and genies</li>
    <li>Singletons</li>
    <li>Boxing methods and tripwires</li>
    <li>Mind crime</li>
    <li>Humanity's cosmic endowment</li>
    <li>Differential technological development</li>
    <li>Indirect normativity and instrumental convergence</li>
    <li>Whole brain emulation and technology couplings</li>
    <li>Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence and biological cognitive enhancement</li>
    <li>Collective intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>This profoundly ambitious and original book carefully traverses a challenging intellectual landscape. Despite its complexity, the writing is so clear that it makes the material accessible. After an engaging journey to the frontiers of human thought and the future of intelligent life, Nick Bostrom's work offers a reconceptualization of the essential tasks of our time.</p>

"9780007582914","Tolkien On Fairy-Stories by Verlyn Flieger","
<h1>Tolkien On Fairy-Stories by Verlyn Flieger</h1>
<p>A new expanded edition of Tolkien's most famous and important essay, which defined his conception of fantasy as a literary form and led to the writing of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. This edition is accompanied by a critical study of the history and writing of the text.</p>
<p>J.R.R. Tolkien's ""On Fairy-stories"" is his most-studied and most-quoted essay, serving as an exemplary personal statement of his views on the role of imagination in literature. It is an intellectual tour de force vital for understanding Tolkien's achievement in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. The essay comprises about 18,000 words.</p>
<p>What is little-known is that when Tolkien expanded the essay in 1943, he wrote many additional pages of his views that were originally condensed or cut from the published version. These unpublished passages may amount to half again as much writing as the essay itself and contain important elaborations of his views on other writers, representing a significant addition to Tolkien studies.</p>
<p>This new critical study includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An introductory essay setting the stage for Tolkien's 1939 lecture (the origin of the essay) and placing it within a historical context.</li>
    <li>A history of the writing of 'On Fairy-stories', covering the original lecture and its first publication in 1947.</li>
    <li>The essay as published in corrected form in <em>Tree and Leaf</em> (1964).</li>
    <li>Commentary on the allusions in the text and notes about the revisions Tolkien made.</li>

Accompanied by a critical study of the history and writing of the text. J.R.R. Tolkien's ""On Fairy-stories"" is his most-studied and most-quoted essay, an exemplary personal statement of his views on the role of imagination in literature, and an intellectual tour de force vital for understanding Tolkien's achievement in the writing of The Lord of the Rings. ""On Fairy-stories"" comprises about 18,000 words. What is little-known is that when Tolkien expanded the essay in 1943, he wrote many more pages of his views that were originally condensed into or cut from the published version. An estimate is difficult, but these unpublished passages perhaps amount to half again as much writing as the essay itself. These passages contain important elaborations of his views on other writers, and their publication represents a significant addition to Tolkien studies. Included in this new critical study of the work are: An introductory essay setting the stage for Tolkien's 1939 lecture (the origin of the essay) and placing it within a historical context. A history of the writing of 'On Fairy-stories', beginning with coverage of the original lecture as delivered, and continuing through to first publication in 1947. The essay proper as published in corrected form in Tree and Leaf (1964). Commentary on the allusions in the text, and notes about the revisions Tolkien made to the text as published in Tree and Leaf. Important material not included in the essay as published, with commentary by the editors. Contained within ""On Fairy-stories"" are the roots of the tree of tales that bore such glittering fruit in Tolkien's published and unpublished work.

<h1>A Room of One's Own</h1>
<h2>by Virginia Woolf</h2>
<p>'But, you may say, we asked you to speak about women and fiction - what has that got to do with a room of one's own?' A Room of One's Own grew out of a lecture that Virginia Woolf was invited to give at Girton College, Cambridge in 1928. It has since become a landmark work of feminist thought.</p>
<p>This book covers essential topics such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why a woman must have money and a room of her own to write</li>
    <li>Influential authors like Jane Austen, Aphra Behn, and the Bronte sisters</li>
    <li>The tragic story of Shakespeare's fictional sister, Judith</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead</h2>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Olga Tokarczuk</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> With <em>Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead</em>, Man Booker International Prize-winner Olga Tokarczuk returns with a subversive, entertaining noir novel. In a remote Polish village, Janina Duszejko, an eccentric woman in her sixties, recounts the events surrounding the disappearance of her two dogs.</p>
<p>She is reclusive, preferring the company of animals to people; she's unconventional, believing in the stars; and she is fond of the poetry of William Blake, from whose work the title of the book is taken.</p>
<p>When members of a local hunting club are found murdered, Duszejko becomes involved in the investigation. By no means a conventional crime story, this existential thriller by 'one of Europe's major humanist writers' (Guardian) offers thought-provoking ideas on our perceptions of madness, injustice against marginalized people, animal rights, the hypocrisy of traditional religion, and belief in predestination.</p>
<p>This novel has caused a genuine political uproar in Tokarczuk's native Poland.</p>

    <p>An extraordinary debut from a young Vietnamese American, <em>Night Sky with Exit Wounds</em> is a book of poetry unlike any other. Steeped in war and cultural upheaval and wielding a fresh new language, Vuong writes about the most profound subjects - love and loss, conflict, grief, memory, and desire. He attends to them all with lines that feel newly-minted, graceful in their cadences, passionate and hungry in their tender, close attention:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“...the chief of police facedown in a pool of Coca-Cola. A palm-sized photo of his father soaking beside his left ear.”</p>

<h1>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h1>
<h2>by Stephen Chbosky</h2>
<p><strong>A moving coming-of-age classic</strong></p>
<p>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up. Now a major motion picture starring <em>Emma Watson</em> and <em>Logan Lerman</em>. Stephen Chbosky's new film <em>Wonder</em>, starring <em>Owen Wilson</em> and <em>Julia Roberts</em>, is out now.</p>
<p>Charlie is a freshman. While he's not the biggest geek in school, he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, and intelligent beyond his years yet socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it.</p>
<p>Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mix-tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite.</p>
<p>But Charlie can't stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective, but there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.</p>

    <h2>Oh William! by Elizabeth Strout</h2>
    <p><strong>SHORTLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE 2022</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The TOP 10 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER</strong></p>
    <p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning, Booker-longlisted, bestselling author returns to her beloved heroine Lucy Barton in a luminous novel about love, loss, and the family secrets that can erupt and bewilder us at any point in life.</p>
    <p>Lucy Barton is a successful writer living in New York, navigating the second half of her life as a recent widow and parent to two adult daughters. A surprise encounter leads her to reconnect with William, her first husband—and longtime, on-again-off-again friend and confidante.</p>
    <p>Recalling their college years, the birth of their daughters, the painful dissolution of their marriage, and the lives they built with other people, Strout weaves a portrait, stunning in its subtlety, of a tender, complex, decades-long partnership.</p>
    <p><strong>Oh William!</strong> captures the joy and sorrow of watching children grow up and start families of their own; of discovering family secrets, late in life, that alter everything we think we know about those closest to us; and the way people live and love, against all odds.</p>
    <p>At the heart of this story is the unforgettable, indomitable voice of Lucy Barton, who once again offers a profound, lasting reflection on the mystery of existence. 'This is the way of life,' Lucy says. 'The many things we do not know until it is too late.'</p>

<h1>Bess Of Hardwick: First Lady of Chatsworth</h1>
<h2>by Mary S. Lovell</h2>
<p>Bess of Hardwick was one of the most remarkable women of the Tudor era. Born into reduced circumstances, she was married at 15, wedded at 16, and still a virgin. At 19, she married Sir William Cavendish, a man more than twice her age and a senior auditor in King Henry VIII's Court of Augmentations. Responsible for seizing church properties for the crown during the Dissolution, Cavendish enriched himself in the process.</p>
<p>During the reign of King Edward VI, Cavendish served as Treasurer to the boy king and his sisters, allowing Bess and him to move in the highest levels of society. They had a London home and built Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. After Cavendish's death, her third husband was poisoned by his brother. Bess' fourth marriage to George, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl Marshall of England, made her one of the most important women at court.</p>
<p>Her shrewd business acumen was renowned, and she was said to possess 'a masculine understanding' in an age when women had little education and few legal rights. Following the Earl's death, Bess became arguably the wealthiest and, next to the Queen, the most powerful woman in the country.</p>

From her early beginnings as a freelance journalist, Alderton quickly ascended through the ranks of British media, contributing to major publications such as The Sunday Times, GQ, and Marie Claire. Her reputation for incisive reporting and sharp commentary on lifestyle and relationship topics brought her mainstream recognition and a slew of awards. However, it was her foray into the world of books that skyrocketed her into the public consciousness. Her bestselling memoir Everything I Know About Love was published in 2018 to widespread acclaim. The book was a runaway success, garnering numerous awards and becoming a staple on bestseller lists. It resonated deeply with readers of all ages for its honest, humorous, and often poignant reflections on love in all its forms.

In her memoir, she vividly recounts falling in love, wrestling with self-sabotage, finding a job, throwing a socially disastrous Rod-Stewart-themed house party, getting drunk, getting dumped, realising that Ivan from the corner shop is the only man you've ever been able to rely on, and finding that your mates are always there at the end of every messy night out.

<h1>The Tao of Pooh & The Te of Piglet</h1>
<h2>by Benjamin Hoff</h2>
<p>""It's hard to be brave,"" said Piglet, sniffing slightly, ""when you're only a Very Small Animal."" Rabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said: ""It is because you are a very small animal that you will be useful in the adventure before us.""</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh has a certain way about him, a way of doing things that has made him the world's most beloved bear. Pooh's Way, as Benjamin Hoff brilliantly demonstrates, seems strangely close to the ancient Chinese principles of Taoism. As for Piglet, he embodies the very important principle of Te, meaning Virtue of the Small.</p>
<p>Benjamin Hoff's explanations of Taoism and Te through Pooh and Piglet show that this is not an ancient and remote philosophy but something that you can use, here and now. This utterly unique book makes complex concepts accessible with a little help from Pooh and his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood.</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <h3>Britt-Marie Was Here</h3>
    <p>The number 1 European bestseller by the author of New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon <em>A Man Called Ove</em>, <strong>Britt-Marie Was Here</strong> is a funny, poignant and uplifting tale of love, community, and second chances. For as long as anyone can remember, Britt-Marie has been an acquired taste. It's not that she's judgemental, or fussy, or difficult - she just expects things to be done in a certain way. A cutlery drawer should be arranged in the right order, for example (forks, knives, then spoons). We're not animals, are we?</p>
    <p>But behind the passive-aggressive, socially awkward, absurdly pedantic busybody is a woman who has more imagination, bigger dreams and a warmer heart than anyone around her realizes. So when Britt-Marie finds herself unemployed, separated from her husband of 20 years, left to fend for herself in the miserable provincial backwater that is Borg - of which the kindest thing one can say is that it has a road going through it - and somehow tasked with running the local football team, she is a little unprepared. But she will learn that life may have more to offer her than she's ever realized, and love might be found in the most unexpected of places.</p>
    
    <h3>My Grandmother Sends Her Regards and Apologises</h3>
    <p>A must-read for fans of Rachel Joyce's <em>The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</em> and Maria Semple's <em>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</em>. Heartbreaking and hilarious in equal measure, by the author of the New York Times bestselling phenomenon <em>A Man Called Ove</em>, this book will charm and delight anyone who has ever had a grandmother.</p>
    <p>Everyone remembers the smell of their grandmother's house. Everyone remembers the stories their grandmother told them. But does everyone remember their grandmother flirting with policemen? Driving illegally? Breaking into a zoo in the middle of the night? Firing a paintball gun from a balcony in her dressing gown? Seven-year-old Elsa does. Some might call Elsa's granny 'eccentric', or even 'crazy'. Elsa calls her a superhero. And granny's stories, of knights and princesses and dragons and castles, are her superpower. Because, as Elsa is starting to learn, heroes and villains don't always exist in imaginary kingdoms; they could live just down the hallway.</p>
    <p>As Christmas draws near, even the best superhero grandmothers may have one or two things they'd like to apologise for. And, in the process, Elsa can have some breathtaking adventures of her own ...</p>
    
    <h3>A Man Called Ove</h3>
    <p>At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association.

<p>After ten years, I have left the grips of one king only to fall into the hands of another.

Leading the army is Commander Rip, a notorious warrior whose name is whispered in taverns and street corners all over the six kingdoms. But as I get to know him, I realize that the tales of his brutality aren't true. He is something else. He is fae. Part of the powerful and magical people who are said to have abandoned this world entirely three hundred years ago. But here one stands before me. And when he turns his onyx eyes upon me, I fall captive. For an entirely different reason.</p>

    <p><strong>THE GLOBAL PHENOMENON THAT HAS TOUCHED THE HEARTS OF OVER 9 MILLION READERS</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>'Mitch Albom sees the magical in the ordinary' - Cecelia Ahern</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Maybe it was a grandparent, a teacher, or a colleague? Someone older, patient, and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you navigate life? For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago. Perhaps, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you moved forward, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again and ask the bigger questions that still haunt you?</p>
    <p>Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live. <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em> is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world.</p>

    <h2>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</h2>
    <h3>by Simon Armitage</h3>
    <p>Preserved on a single surviving manuscript dating from around 1400, composed by an anonymous master, <strong>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</strong> was rediscovered only 200 years ago and published for the first time in 1839. One of the earliest great stories of English literature, after <em>Beowulf</em>, the poem narrates the strange tale of a green knight on a green horse, who rudely interrupts the Round Table festivities one Yuletide, casting a pall of unease over the company and challenging one of their number to a wager.</p>
    <p>The virtuous Gawain accepts, decapitates the intruder with his own axe, and, gushing blood, the knight reclaims his head, orders Gawain to seek him out a year hence, and departs. Next Yuletide, Gawain dutifully sets forth on his quest for the Green Knight, which involves a winter journey, a seduction scene in a dream-like castle, a dire challenge answered, and a drama of enigmatic reward disguised as psychic undoing.</p>

<h1>The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins</h1>
<h2>by Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing</h2>
<p><strong>What a rare mushroom can teach us about sustaining life on a fragile planet.</strong></p>
<p>Matsutake is the most valuable mushroom in the world—and a weed that grows in human-disturbed forests across the northern hemisphere. Through its ability to nurture trees, matsutake helps forests to grow in daunting places. It is also an edible delicacy in Japan, where it sometimes commands astronomical prices.</p>
<p>In all its contradictions, matsutake offers insights into areas far beyond just mushrooms and addresses a crucial question: what manages to live in the ruins we have made? A tale of diversity within our damaged landscapes, <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em> follows one of the strangest commodity chains of our times to explore the unexpected corners of capitalism.</p>
<p>Here, we witness the varied and peculiar worlds of matsutake commerce: the worlds of Japanese gourmets, capitalist traders, Hmong jungle fighters, industrial forests, Yi Chinese goat herders, Finnish nature guides, and more. These companions also lead us into fungal ecologies and forest histories to better understand the promise of cohabitation in a time of massive human destruction.</p>
<p>By investigating one of the world's most sought-after fungi, <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em> presents an original examination into the relation between capitalist destruction and collaborative survival within multispecies landscapes, the prerequisite for continuing life on earth.</p>

<h1>Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!</h1>
<h2>by Robert T. Kiyosaki</h2>

<p>April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic <strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong>, which still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. Despite the passage of 25 years since its initial publication, the core lessons about money and the principles outlined in the book remain unchanged. In a rapidly evolving world, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki's international bestseller are more relevant than ever.</p>

<h3>Milestones</h3>
<p>This milestone is commemorated with a new section in the book on <em>Why Milestones Are Important</em>. The integrity of the original content is preserved, demonstrating that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars, updated for the 20-year anniversary edition, have been revised again, but the core principles continue to resonate with parents and grandparents who share Robert's story with new generations. Its timeless wisdom and practical lessons can be applied to anyone's life and vision for a financially secure future.</p>

In the 25 years since <strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong> was first published on April 8, 1997, many aspects of our world have changed, yet the pressing need for financial education remains constant.

We can all become smarter about money and learn to secure our futures.</p>

<h3>Still the One... #1</h3>
<p>Today, <strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong> consistently ranks among bestsellers worldwide in Personal Finance, Parenting, and Investing. It has been translated into 38 languages and has sold over 40 million copies globally. The book narrates Robert's experiences growing up with two dads—his biological father and his best friend's wealthy father—and how both shaped his views on money and investing.</p>

    <li>Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich</li>

People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we've learned, and celebrate accomplishments... and they give meaning to our life's journey. They are a way that we integrate past, present, and future... looking back at where we started, where we are today... and the promise of all that the future can hold. In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published - 25 years since April 8, 1997 - so many things in our world have changed. But the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives, like it or not, and technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money.

The perfect summer read for fans of Adam Silvera, Casey McQuiston, Becky Albertalli and Alice Oseman's HEARTSTOPPER series!Alex and Molly are two girls who don't belong on the same planet, let alone the same college campus . . . Alex Blackwood is a little bit headstrong, with a dash of chaos and a whole lot of flirt. She knows how to get the girl. Keeping her on the other hand . . . not so much. Molly Parker has everything in her life totally in control, except for her complete awkwardness with just about anyone besides her mum. She knows she's in love with the impossibly cool Cora Myers. She just . . . hasn't actually talked to her yet. When the girls' paths cross unexpectedly, and Alex discovers Molly's hidden crush, they realise they might have a common interest after all. Because maybe if Alex can help Molly to get her dream girl, she can prove to her ex that she's serious about love. As the two embark on their five-step plans to get their girls to fall for them, though, they both begin to wonder if maybe they're the ones falling . . . for each other. Read what everyone is saying about She Gets the Girl:'Adorable. There's no better word to describe this book. It is so full of hilarious & cute moments that it is bursting at the seams.' - Amazon reviewer 'A great sapphic rom-com style story. I truly loved reading this book from start to finish!' - Amazon reviewer 'The ending made me swoon.' - Amazon reviewer 'Both hilarious and poignant, no doubt in my mind that this gem will be one of the best books I read this year.' - Amazon reviewer ; 384 pages; Published: 14/04/2022","","","","","9.7814E+12","en","","","Simon & Schuster Ltd","Author_Rachael Lippincott, Binding_Paperback, Extended Range, Genre_Romance & relationships stories (Children's / Teenage), Imprint_Simon & Schuster Ltd","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

<h2>The King Who Banned the Dark</h2>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Emily Haworth-Booth</p>
<p>When a King bans the dark completely, installing an artificial sun and enforcing ""anti-dark"" laws, it seems like a good idea.

<p>There was once a little boy who was afraid of the dark. There's nothing unusual about that. Most children are afraid of the dark at one time or another. But this little boy was a Prince, and he decided that when he became King, he would do something about the dark. He would ban it.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Raina Telgemeier, the author of the award-winning <em>SMILE</em>, brings us her next full-colour graphic novel . . . <strong>DRAMA!</strong></p>
<p>Callie loves theatre. While she would love to try out for her middle school's production of <em>Moon Over Mississippi</em>, she's a terrible singer. Instead, she takes on the role of set designer for the stage crew, determined to create a set worthy of Broadway on a middle-school budget.</p>
<p>However, challenges arise as she lacks carpentry skills, ticket sales are down, and the crew members struggle to work together. The onstage and offstage drama intensifies once the actors are chosen, especially when two cute brothers enter the picture, making things even crazier!</p>

    <h2>Bluets by Maggie Nelson</h2>
    <p><strong>AS SEEN ON BBC2's BETWEEN THE COVERS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A Guardian Book of the Year</strong></p>
    <p>Maggie Nelson is one of the most electrifying writers at work in America today, among the sharpest and most supple thinkers of her generation - Olivia Laing.</p>
    <p><em>Bluets</em> winds its way through depression, divinity, alcohol, and desire, visiting along the way with famous blue figures, including Joni Mitchell, Billie Holiday, Yves Klein, Leonard Cohen, and Andy Warhol. While its narrator sets out to construct a sort of 'pillow book' about her lifelong obsession with the colour blue, she ends up facing down both the painful end of an affair and the grievous injury of a dear friend.</p>
    <p>The combination produces a raw, cerebral work devoted to the inextricability of pleasure and pain, and to the question of what role, if any, aesthetic beauty can play in times of great heartache or grief. Much like Roland Barthes's <em>A Lover's Discourse</em>, <em>Bluets</em> has passed between lovers in the ecstasy of new love, and been pressed into the hands of the heartbroken.</p>
    <p>Visceral, learned, and acutely lucid, <em>Bluets</em> is a slim feat of literary innovation and grace, never before published in the UK.</p>

<h1>Ryan's Christmas: A DCI Ryan Mystery</h1>
<h2>by LJ Ross</h2>
<p><strong>Christmas can be murder...</strong></p>
<p>After a busy year fighting crime, DCI Ryan and his team of murder detectives are enjoying a festive season of goodwill, mulled wine, and, in the case of DS Phillips, a stottie cake or two. However, a freak snowstorm forces their car off the main road and into the remote heart of Northumberland.</p>
<p>Their Christmas spirit is soon tested when they're forced to find shelter inside England's most haunted castle, where they're the uninvited guests at a <em>'Candlelit Ghost Hunt'</em>. It's all fun and games—until one of the guests is murdered. It seems no mortal hand could have committed the crime, so Ryan and his team must face the spectres living inside the castle walls to uncover the grisly truth before another ghost joins their number.</p>

<h1>The Wall: Discover this addictive dystopia from the Vintage Earth series</h1>
<p>When her cousin and wife fail to return from a walk, this story takes a sinister turn to a quest of survival. A woman takes a holiday in the Austrian mountains, spending a few days with her cousin and his wife in their hunting lodge.

<p>She discovers only a transparent wall behind which there seems to be no life. Trapped alone behind the mysterious wall, she begins the arduous work of survival. This is at once a simple account of potatoes and beans, of hoping for a calf, of counting matches, of forgetting the taste of sugar and the use of one's name, and simultaneously a disturbing dissection of the place of human beings in the natural world.</p>

    <h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
    <p>Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</p>
    <h3>Catching Fire</h3>
    <p>After winning the brutal Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta return to their district, hoping for a peaceful future. But their victory has caused rebellion to break out ... and the Capitol has decided that someone must pay. As Katniss and Peeta are forced to visit the districts on the Capitol's Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. Unless they can convince the world that they are still lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.</p>
    <h3>Mockingjay</h3>
    <p>Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice. But now that she's left the bloody arena alive, she's still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. Worse, President Snow has clarified that no one else is safe—not Katniss's family, friends, or the people of District 12.</p>

In the Capitol, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow prepares for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmanoeuvre his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute. The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are wholly intertwined -every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favour or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.","","","","","9.7807E+12","en","","","Scholastic","","","","","","","","","g","","","active"

    <h1>Macbeth the Graphic Novel: Original Text</h1>
    <p>This is William Shakespeare's full and unabridged play in comic book form. This full-color graphic novel presents ""The Scottish Play"" just as Shakespeare intended: in its original and unabridged format. Ideal for purists, students, and readers who will appreciate the unaltered text.</p>
    <p>""Macbeth"" is probably the most dramatic of Shakespeare's tragedies, and this version will give you a brand new and totally fulfilling view of the sheer genius of Shakespeare's storytelling. Witchcraft, superstition, murder - it's all here!</p>
    <p>Featuring stunning artwork, and full of action, atmosphere, and intrigue from start to finish; this new treatment of The Bard's wonderful tragedy will have you on the edge of your seat.</p>
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>It's 11th century Scotland. Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, is one of King Duncan's greatest war captains. Upon returning from a battle with the rebellious Thane of Cawdor, Macbeth and Banquo encounter three witches, who prophecy that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor and then King. They also prophecy that Banquo will become the father of kings.</p>
    <p>When Lady Macbeth hears this, she is determined to push her husband to take fate into his own hands and make himself king by murdering Duncan. Macbeth is reluctant to harm Duncan. But, when the King makes arrangements to visit Macbeth's castle, the opportunity presents itself. Pressed on by his wife, Macbeth kills Duncan and blames the King's drunken attendants, who he also kills.</p>
    <p>However, Macbeth is racked with guilt and begins to see apparitions. When the body is discovered, Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's sons, are suspicious of Macbeth and flee for their lives. To everyone else, it looks as if the sons have been the chief conspirators, and Macbeth is crowned King of Scotland.</p>
    <p>Banquo's suspicions grow, based on his encounter with the witches, and Macbeth is wary of the second prophecy concerning Banquo's offspring. Macbeth hires assassins to kill Banquo and his son, Fleance. Banquo is murdered that night, but Fleance escapes. The bloody ghost of Banquo appears to Macbeth at a feast, tormenting his already guilty conscience.</p>
    <p>In addition, Macduff, once a comrade of Macbeth, has fled after the King's sons to England, as he also suspects Macbeth. In revenge, Macbeth butchers Macduff's entire household. Macduff and the King's sons raise an army in England and march against Macbeth, who is given another prophecy by the witches as he prepares for the assault.</p>
    <p>They tell him his throne is safe until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane and he will not die by the hand of any man born of a woman. Macbeth now feels invincible. Lady Macbeth, on the other hand, has been slowly driven mad by her dreams, in the wake of Duncan's murder. She sleepwalks and eventually kills herself.</p>
    <p>Macbeth learns that many of his lords are deserting and joining Malcolm's army, which approaches Dunsinane under cover of boughs, which they've cut from the trees of Birnam Wood. Macbeth and Macduff eventually meet on the bloody battlefield. Macbeth laughs derisively, relating the witches' prophecy. But Macduff retorts that he was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd and not (technically) of woman born. The play ends with the death of Macbeth and Malcolm is crowned King of Scotland.</p>

<h1>Think And Grow Rich</h1>
<h2>by Napoleon Hill</h2>
<p>The single greatest guide to achieving success ever written, featuring a new foreword by television star and entrepreneur Steve Harvey!</p>
<p><strong>Think and Grow Rich</strong>, first published in 1937, took more than twenty years of research to compile. Napoleon Hill was a journalist and writer who later served as an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1936. His big break came with his interview of Andrew Carnegie in 1908.</p>
<p>Intrigued by Carnegie's assertion that the path to success could be broken down into a simple yet comprehensive formula, Hill accepted Carnegie's challenge to study and interview more than five hundred extremely successful individuals to determine what they owed their vast achievements.</p>
<p>This masterwork identifies thirteen principles that every person should adopt if they are serious about achieving success—all are empirically based on the aforementioned decades of research. Hill has synthesized what wealthy and/or exceptionally successful individuals have in common.</p>
<p>This classic guide is one of the bestselling books of all time, having sold twenty million copies by Hill's death in 1970. With razor focus, desire, persistence, and perseverance, you too can join the likes of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Andrew Carnegie.</p>

<h1>Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction</h1>
<p><strong>THE NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER NOW A MAJOR FILM, STARRING STEVE CARELL AND BAFTA AND GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATED TIMOTHEE CHALAMET</strong></p>
<p>'What had happened to my beautiful boy? To our family? What did I do wrong?' These wrenching questions haunted every moment of David Sheff's journey through his son Nic's addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery.</p>
<p>Before Nic Sheff became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy—joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets.</p>
<p>With haunting candor, David Sheff traces the first subtle warning signs: the denial, the 3 AM phone calls (is it Nic? the police? the hospital?), and the attempts at rehab. His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself, and the obsessive worry and stress took a tremendous toll.</p>
<p>As a journalist, he instinctively researched every avenue of treatment that might save his son and refused to give up on Nic. This story is a first: a teenager's addiction from the parent's point of view—a real-time chronicle of the shocking descent into substance abuse and the gradual emergence into hope.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful Boy</strong> is a fiercely candid memoir that brings immediacy to the emotional rollercoaster of loving a child who seems beyond help. Read the other side of Nic Sheff's bestselling memoir, <em>Tweak</em>.</p>

<h2>A Clash of Kings</h2>
<p><strong>HBO's hit series A GAME OF THRONES</strong> is based on George R R Martin's internationally bestselling series <em>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE</em>, the greatest fantasy epic of the modern age. <strong>A CLASH OF KINGS</strong> is the second volume in the series.</p>
<p><em>'Nobody does fantasy quite like Martin'</em> - Sunday Times</p>
<p>Throughout Westeros, the cold winds are rising. From the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding lands of Winterfell, chaos reigns as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the colour of blood and flame—five factions struggle for control of a divided land. Brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Against a backdrop of incest, fratricide, alchemy, and murder, the price of glory is measured in blood.</p>

<p>If <em>Gossip Girl</em> and <em>Made in Chelsea</em> had a baby, it would be this book.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>'How many loves do you get in a lifetime?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is a beautiful, affluent, self-involved, and mildly neurotic London socialite. He is Britain's most photographed bad-boy who broke her heart. Magnolia Parks and BJ Ballentine are meant to be, and everyone knows it. She dates other people to keep him at bay; he sleeps with other girls to get back at her for it. But at the end of their every sad endeavor to get over one another, it's still each other they crawl back to.</p>
<p>Now their dysfunction is catching up with them, pulling at their seams and fraying the world they've built; a world where neither has ever let the other go completely. As the cracks start to show and secrets begin to surface, Magnolia and BJ are finally forced to face the formidable question they've been avoiding all their lives: <strong>How many loves do you really get in a lifetime?</strong></p>

<div class=""book-description"">
    <h1>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</h1>
    <h2>by Anne Bronte</h2>
    <p><strong>One of the BBC's '100 Novels That Shaped Our World'</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Penguin English Library Edition</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“She looked so like herself that I knew not how to bear it.”</p>
    </blockquote>

<h1>A View from the Bridge</h1>
<h2>by Arthur Miller</h2>
<p>Arthur Miller's play <em>A View from the Bridge</em> is a tragic masterpiece of the inexorable unravelling of a man, set in a close-knit Italian-American community in 1950s New York. Eddie Carbone is a longshoreman and a straightforward man, with a strong sense of decency and honour.</p>
<p>For Eddie, it's a privilege to take in his wife's cousins, Marco and Rodolpho, straight off the boat from Italy. However, as his niece Catherine begins to fall for one of them, it's clear that it's not just, as Eddie claims, that he's too strange, too sissy, too careless for her, but that something bigger, deeper is wrong - and wrong inside Eddie, in a way he can't face. This threatens the happiness of their whole family.</p>

<h1>Winnie-the-Pooh</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders. Curl up with a true children's classic by reading A.A. Milne's <strong>Winnie-the-Pooh</strong>. Winnie-the-Pooh may be a bear of very little brain, but thanks to his friends Piglet, Eeyore, and, of course, Christopher Robin, he's never far from an adventure.</p>
<p>In this story, Pooh gets into a tight place, nearly catches a Woozle, and heads off on an 'expotition' to the North Pole with the other animals. In this stunning edition of <strong>Winnie-the-Pooh</strong>, A.A. Milne's world-famous story is once again brought to life by E.H. Shepard's illustrations. Heart-warming and funny, Milne's masterpiece reflects the power of a child's imagination like no other story before or since.</p>
<p>Do you own all the classic Pooh titles?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Winnie-the-Pooh</li>
    <li>The House at Pooh Corner</li>
    <li>When We Were Very Young</li>
    <li>Now We Are Six</li>
</ul>
<p>Also look out for <strong>Return to the Hundred Acre Wood</strong> and <strong>The Best Bear in all the World</strong> (coming soon). Pooh ranks alongside other beloved characters such as Paddington Bear and Peter Rabbit as an essential part of our literary heritage. Whether you're 5 or 55, Pooh is the bear for all ages.</p>
<p>A.A. Milne is quite simply one of the most famous children's authors of all time. He created Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger, Kanga, and Roo based on the real nursery toys played with by his son, Christopher Robin. These characters not only became the stars of his classic children's books, <strong>Winnie-the-Pooh</strong> and <strong>The House at Pooh Corner</strong>, and his poetry for children, but they have also been adapted for film, TV, and the stage.</p>
<p>Through his writings for <em>Punch</em> magazine, A.A. Milne met E.H. Shepard, who went on to draw the original illustrations to accompany Milne's classics, earning him the name ""the man who drew Pooh.""</p>

<div class=""book-description"">
    <h2>The Land of Roar</h2>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jenny McLachlan</p>
    <p>The first in a new children's fantasy adventure series, <em>The Land of Roar</em> is full of imagination, humour, and heart, echoing classics like <em>Peter Pan</em>, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, <em>The Neverending Story</em>, and <em>Jumanji</em>. Perfect for children aged 8 to 12, it can sit alongside <em>Nevermoor</em>, <em>Wizards of Once</em>, and <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> on their bookshelves.</p>
    
    <p>Readers can bring their fantasy world to life and meet dragons, unicorns, mermaids, and more in this beautifully illustrated book. Believing is just the beginning...</p>
    
    <p>When Arthur and Rose were little, they were heroes in the Land of Roar, an imaginary world they discovered by climbing through the folding bed in their grandad's attic. Roar was filled with beloved creatures—dragons, mermaids, ninja wizards—and thrilling adventures, as well as fears, including a very creepy scarecrow. Now eleven, the twins see Roar as just a memory. But when they help Grandad clean the attic, Arthur is horrified as Grandad is pulled into the folding bed and vanishes. Is it a joke, or is Roar... real?</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>'This funny, captivating story is filled with the painful pangs of growing up and the transporting qualities of imagination.' - <em>Guardian</em></p>
        <p>'A vividly imagined adventure, [...] full of heart, humour and a terrifying villain.' - Fiona Noble, <em>The Bookseller</em></p>
        <p>'This is proof, not that it's needed, that Jenny McLachlan is a writer of enormous heart and versatility. I'm a really big fan.' - Phil Earle, award-winning author</p>
        <p>'Roar is an exhilarating, hilarious, vividly drawn tribute to the power of childhood imagination, the love of family, and the magic we risk losing as we grow up. If you plan to visit one new place in 2019, make it Roar.' - Sarah Driver, author of <em>The Huntress</em> trilogy</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Jenny McLachlan is the author of several acclaimed teen novels, including <em>Flirty Dancing</em>, <em>Stargazing for Beginners</em>, and <em>Truly, Wildly, Deeply</em>. Before becoming a writer, she was Head of English in a secondary school and now enjoys visiting schools to deliver funny and inspiring talks and workshops. When not writing, she loves living by the seaside, cycling, and running over the South Downs. <em>The Land of Roar</em> is her middle-grade debut.</p>

The Land of Roar is perfect for children aged 8 to 12, and can sit on their bookshelf next to Nevermoor, Wizards of Once and How to Train Your Dragon. Readers can bring their fantasy world to life and meet dragons, unicorns, mermaids and more in this beautifully illustrated children's book. Believing is just the beginning ... When Arthur and Rose were little, they were heroes in the Land of Roar, an imaginary world that they found by climbing through the folding bed in their grandad's attic. Roar was filled with things they loved - dragons, mermaids, ninja wizards and adventure - as well as things that scared them (including a very creepy scarecrow...) Now the twins are eleven, Roar is just a memory. But when they help Grandad clean out the attic, Arthur is horrified as Grandad is pulled into the folding bed and vanishes. Is he playing a joke? Or is Roar ... real?

I'm a really big fan' Phil Earle, award-winning author of Being Billy and co-author of Get Me Out of Here! with Andy McNab 'Roar is an exhilarating, hilarious, vividly drawn tribute to the power of the childhood imagination, the love of family and the magic we risk losing as we grow up.

Before Jenny became a writer, she was Head of English in a secondary school; she now loves visiting schools as an author and delivering funny and inspiring talks and workshops. When Jenny isn't thinking about stories or writing stories, she enjoys living by the seaside, cycling and running over the South Downs. The Land of Roar is Jenny's middle-grade debut.

<h1>The Girl Who Stole an Elephant</h1>
<h2>by Nizrana Farook</h2>
<p>Chaya, a no-nonsense, outspoken hero, leads her friends and a gorgeous elephant on a noisy, fraught, joyous adventure through the jungle where revolution is stirring and leeches lurk. Will stealing the queen's jewels be the beginning or the end of everything for the intrepid gang?</p>
<p>With cover illustration by David Dean, <strong>The Girl Who Stole an Elephant</strong> is as rich, dazzling, and alluring as a pouchful of royal jewels, and as triumphant as a trumpeting elephant! I loved it. - <em>Sophie Anderson</em>, author of <strong>The House with Chicken Legs</strong></p>
<p>A glorious fast-paced adventure through the jungle. I love Chaya's spirit and determination and the friendships that are built along the way. I feel I am there with Chaya and her friends. <strong>The Girl Who Stole an Elephant</strong> is adventuring at its best; a mystery, a jewel thief, and an escape into the jungle with an elephant at your side. - <em>Gill Lewis</em>, author of <strong>Sky Hawk</strong></p>
<p>Chaya, schoolgirl by day, thief by night, will steal your heart in this incredibly assured debut that's packed with adventure, friendship, and loyalty. - <em>Aisha Bushby</em>, author of <strong>A Pocketful of Stars</strong></p>
<p>This exciting debut, set on the lush island of ancient Sri Lanka, introduces us to a kick-ass heroine in Chaya, a young girl who robs the rich to help the poor in local villages. Richly atmospheric, full of colour and passion, Farook is a writer to watch. - <em>Sally Morris</em>, <strong>Daily Mail</strong></p>
<p>Farook embeds her message in a cracking narrative and never lets us feel we're being preached to. Chaya looked at the bronze spear pointing at her neck, reads the novel's first sentence and in the ensuing 48 chapters, the pace rarely slackens. But she allows every character time to unravel, resulting in a deceptively dense adventure that will appeal to readers well into their teens. - <em>Emily Bearn</em>, <strong>Telegraph</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Girl Who Stole an Elephant</strong> positively rustles with the textures of rural Sri Lanka. It introduces an author keen to write a love letter to her culture, and upend preconceptions too. More like this, please. - <em>Observer</em></p>
<p>Farook's dazzling debut novel follows the stubborn jewel thief Chaya, her friends, and the titular elephant through the Sri Lankan jungle in a beautifully paced story of friendship and revolution. - <em>i</em></p>
<p>Readers can still travel to new and exciting places from home with a great adventure story, like <strong>The Girl Who Stole an Elephant</strong> by Nizrana Farook. Set in Sri Lanka, this debut novel follows Chaya, who has a habit of stealing to help those in need, but taking the queen's jewels and the royal elephant means that she's now a target and needs to escape into the jungle. The vivid setting and fast-paced plot will have you captivated until the final page. - <em>Scotsman</em></p>

All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring â€“ the ring that rules them all â€“ which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care.

The Two Towers Frodo and the Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs.

    <p>The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.

    <p>Their fates are now completely intertwined; every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.</p>

<h1>The Secret History by Donna Tartt</h1>
<p>Unveiling <strong>The Secret History</strong> – a captivating, masterfully woven narrative that draws you into a world shrouded in secrecy, intrigue, and moral ambiguity. Tartt's extraordinary debut novel engrosses readers from the outset, inviting them to partake in a unique blend of suspense, classical education, and psychological drama. Purchase the Dark Academia BookTok sensation now available at <a href=""https://www.books2door.com"">Books2Door</a>.</p>

<p>Within the meticulously penned <strong>559 pages</strong> of <em>The Secret History</em>, readers encounter the seemingly serene, yet ominously secretive world of a group of eccentric Classics students at an elite New England college. These six scholars, under the mentorship of their enigmatic professor Julian Morrow, form a private universe replete with ancient Greek rituals and intellectual fervor, unbeknownst to their peers.</p>

<p>The tale is narrated by Richard Papen, a Californian transplant drawn into the elitist allure of his erudite companions. Richard's outsider perspective, coupled with his desire for acceptance, provides a fascinating lens through which readers can uncover the mystery central to the plot. Tartt masterfully unfolds the narrative in reverse, beginning with the shocking revelation of a murderous act, then spiraling back to unravel the how and why.</p>

<p><strong>The Secret History</strong> is not merely a whodunit, but a meticulous exploration of the eerie space where the boundaries between friendship and obsession, love and fear, truth and deception blur. It probes the ethical grey areas, dissecting the human capacity to rationalize sin and the haunting repercussions of such rationalizations.</p>

<p>In this intricate labyrinth of suspense, Tartt's language is a character unto itself. Her prose is rich, poised, and imbued with an intellectual elegance that mirrors the novel's academic environment. From sweeping philosophical discussions to the minutiae of the characters' daily lives, every scene and dialogue springs to life, evoking a palpable, often claustrophobic, atmosphere.</p>

<p>Tartt's characterization is equally impressive. The protagonist, Richard Papen, is a study in human longing and self-deception, while his companions are an enthralling blend of charm and dysfunction. Each character's personality is painted with depth and complexity, resonating with readers long after the final page is turned.</p>

<p>The physical product matches the story's sophistication. <strong>The Secret History</strong> is bound in a sleek, high-quality cover that captures the novel's atmosphere, and the comfortably sized font allows for a seamless reading experience. Every aspect of the book's design ensures it is a pleasure to hold, behold, and delve into.</p>

<p>This compelling narrative is as much a philosophical and psychological exploration as it is a gripping mystery. It poses profound questions about the nature of beauty, the allure of evil, and the slippery nature of morality. It delves into the human condition, exploring what one might be driven to when unchecked by societal norms.</p>

<p>In <strong>The Secret History</strong>, Donna Tartt has crafted an intellectual thriller that captivates readers, compelling them to contemplate the darker aspects of human nature. As one turns the pages, the secret unravels, yet the haunting essence of the story lingers, echoing the enduring question of morality versus desire. Beyond a mere product, <strong>The Secret History</strong> is an experience – a suspenseful, atmospheric journey that keeps you enthralled from the chilling opening line to the climactic conclusion.</p>

About the Author: Donna Tartt is an acclaimed American author known for her intricate narratives and rich prose. She was born on December 23, 1963, in Greenwood, Mississippi. Tartt's storytelling abilities were evident from an early age, as she started writing poetry at age 5 and had a sonnet published when she was only 13. Tartt attended Bennington College in Vermont, where she began a friendship with fellow student Bret Easton Ellis, who later became a successful author himself. It was during her college years that she started working on her first novel, The Secret History , which would later bring her literary fame. The Secret History was published in 1992 and became an immediate bestseller. It is a dark, intellectual thriller set in an elite New England college, with a plot involving classical scholars and a gruesome murder. The novel was celebrated for its compelling plot, gothic undertones, and rich exploration of moral and psychological complexities. Her second novel, The Little Friend , was published a decade later, in 2002. It's a coming-of-age tale set in Tartt's native Mississippi, centring on a 12-year-old girl investigating her brother's unsolved murder. The novel delves into themes of loss, innocence, and the burdens of the past. Tartt's third novel, The Goldfinch , was published in 2013, eleven years after her second book. It tells the story of a young boy who loses his mother in a terrorist attack and subsequently becomes involved in art forgery. The Goldfinch won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014 and was later adapted into a feature film. Tartt's writing style is characterised by her intricate plot construction, evocative descriptions, and complex character development. Her novels, despite their long gestation periods, have a reputation for their meticulously crafted narratives and philosophical depth. Tartt draws readers into her novels with suspenseful plots and keeps them engaged with her astute insights into the human condition. Description from the Publisher: FROM THE PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR OF THE GOLDFINCH â€˜Truly deserving of the accolade Modern Classic, Donna Tartt's bestseller The Secret History is a remarkable achievement - both compelling and elegant, dramatic and playful. 'What we did was terrible, but still, I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry's, too much Greek prose composition - whatever you like.' Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of morality, their lives are changed profoundly and forever. The Secret History is a story of two parts; the chain of events that led to the death of a classmate - and what happened next. 'So irresistible and seductive it's almost a guilty pleasure' Guardian'Donna Tartt is an amazingly good writer. She's dense, she's allusive. She's a gorgeous storytellerâ€™- Stephen King 'A haunting, compelling, and brilliant piece of fiction . . .

    <p>A lone astronaut. An impossible mission. An ally he never imagined.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>'The most enjoyable hard SF I have read in years' - <em>GUARDIAN</em></p>
        <p>'Weir's finest work to date... This is the one book I read last year that I am certain I can recommend to anyone, no matter who, and know they'll love it.' - <em>BRANDON SANDERSON</em></p>
        <p>'If you like a lot of science in your science fiction, Andy Weir is the writer for you... This one has everything fans of old school SF (like me) love.' - <em>GEORGE R.R. MARTIN</em></p>
        <p>'Brilliantly funny and enjoyable. One of the most plausible science fiction books I've ever read.' - <em>TIM PEAKE, astronaut</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.</p>
    <p>His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it's up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery - and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he's got to do it all alone. Or does he?</p>
    <p>An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could imagine it, <strong>Project Hail Mary</strong> is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival <em>The Martian</em> -- while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>'Andy Weir's brilliant Project Hail Mary...is one of those stirring sci-fi novels about every government on Earth banding together, through science, to save civilisation from collapse. I loved it.' - <em>THE TIMES</em></p>
        <p>'A suspenseful portrait of human ingenuity and resilience [that] builds to an unexpectedly moving ending. A winner.' - <em>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</em></p>

This is the one book I read last year that I am certain I can recommend to anyone, no matter who, and know they'll love it.' BRANDON SANDERSON'If you like a lot of science in your science fiction, Andy Weir is the writer for you. . . This one has everything fans of old school SF (like me) love.' GEORGE R.R. MARTIN'Brilliantly funny and enjoyable. One of the most plausible science fiction books I've ever read' TIM PEAKE, astronaut________________________________________Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company. His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it's up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery-and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he's got to do it all alone. Or does he?An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could imagine it, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian -- while taking us to places it never dreamed of going. ________________________________________'One of the most original, compelling, and fun voyages I've ever taken.' ERNEST CLINE, author of Ready Player One and Ready Player Two'Undisputedly the best book I've read in a very, very long time. Mark my words: Project Hail Mary is destined to become a classic.' BLAKE CROUCH'Andy Weir's brilliant Project Hail Mary...is one of those stirring sci-fi novels about every government on Earth banding together, through science, to save civilisation from collapse. I loved it.' THE TIMES'A suspenseful portrait of human ingenuity and resilience [that] builds to an unexpectedly moving ending. A winner.' PUBLISHERS WEEKLY'Weir returns with gusto . . . his writing flows naturally, and his characters and dialogue crackle with energy. With this novel, he takes his place as a genuine star in the mainstream SF world.'

<h1>1984 Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell</h1>
<p>Ravaged by years of war and civil conflict, Britain has changed its name to <strong>Airstrip One</strong> and become part of <strong>Oceania</strong> - one of the three totalitarian blocks dominating the world. It is ruled by a mysterious leader called <strong>Big Brother</strong>, who keeps the population in thrall through strict surveillance and brutal police repression.</p>
<p>In a society where the individual is suppressed and turned into an ""unperson"" for not conforming, and where not only personal thought, but also historical record and language itself are constantly manipulated by the ruling regime, <strong>Ministry of Truth</strong> worker <strong>Winston Smith</strong> tries to make sense of the rebellious thoughts and passions stirring inside him. He finds himself impotent against the inexorable machine that surrounds him and threatens to crush him at any time.</p>
<p>Arguably the greatest dystopian novel of all time and the most influential post-war work of fiction, <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> has enriched the English language with words such as ""Newspeak"", ""doublethink"", and ""thoughtcrime"". It is a riveting read and a groundbreaking exploration of mass surveillance, censorship, and mind control, resonating deeply with the world we live in.</p>

    <p><strong>Published:</strong> 12/12/2019</p>
    <p><strong>Pages:</strong> 352</p>
    <p>The Silent Patient, a psychological thriller written by Alex Michaelides, captivates readers from the very first page. This novel became an instant sensation, praised for its suspenseful plot, complex characters, and surprising twists. With its dark atmosphere and psychological depth, it takes readers on a journey into the twisted mind of a notorious artist and the therapist determined to unlock her secrets.</p>
    
    <p>The story revolves around <strong>Alicia Berenson</strong>, a talented artist who seemingly led a picture-perfect life until the night she shoots her husband Gabriel five times in the face and then never speaks another word. <strong>Theo Faber</strong>, a psychotherapist fascinated by Alicia's case, becomes determined to treat her and uncover the truth behind the murder. He takes a job at The Grove, the psychiatric facility where Alicia resides, and begins his quest to break through her silence.</p>
    
    <p>As Theo delves deeper into Alicia's past, he uncovers a web of secrets and lies, becoming obsessed with understanding the motive behind the crime. The narrative is a roller-coaster ride, filled with unexpected twists and shocking revelations that challenge perceptions and keep readers on the edge of their seats.</p>
    
    <p>The Silent Patient explores themes such as the human psyche, the nature of guilt, the power of art, and the limits of therapy. Michaelides skillfully delves into the depths of the characters' minds, examining the impact of trauma and the consequences of repressed emotions. The complexities of mental health are highlighted, shedding light on the blurred lines between sanity and insanity.</p>
    
    <p>Alicia remains an enigma for much of the book, raising questions about her sanity and motives. Theo, the determined therapist, also harbors secrets, making him a flawed and relatable protagonist. Their interactions offer insights into the complexities of human relationships and the impact of past traumas.</p>
    
    <p>Michaelides' engaging writing style creates an atmospheric and suspenseful narrative. The pacing is masterfully executed, revealing information at strategic moments, heightening tension and keeping readers guessing. The book alternates between Alicia's diary entries leading up to the murder and Theo's present-day investigation, providing different perspectives and building intrigue.</p>
    
    <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of The Silent Patient is its ability to surprise readers. Just when they think they have unraveled the truth, a twist occurs, challenging assumptions and forcing reassessment. The suspense builds steadily, leading to a climactic and emotionally charged resolution. The ending is both shocking and satisfying, tying up loose ends while leaving room for contemplation.</p>
    
    <p>The Silent Patient has garnered widespread acclaim and has become an international bestseller, blending elements of psychological suspense, mystery, and thriller genres seamlessly. It serves as a testament to the enduring appeal of psychological thrillers and the timeless fascination with the human mind.</p>
    
    <p>In The Silent Patient, Alex Michaelides weaves a mesmerizing tale of deception, guilt, and the search for truth. With its engrossing plot, well-drawn characters, and expertly executed twists, the book remains a standout in the realm of psychological thrillers.</p>
